This is a project on making a Java library for tabular data manipulation with CSV support

## Features
- CSV parsing
- Data aggregation
- Statistical operations

# Convention
## Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for method names and variables
- Use PascalCase for class names

## Developing branches convention
- Use `main` for the main branch
- Use `dev` for the development branch
- Use `feature/feature-name` for feature branches  
  for example: `feature/README`
- Use `fix/bug-name` for bug fix branches
- Use `perf/branch-name` for the performance improvement, refactors, or code clean up branches

- All feature, fix and perf need to be inited on the `dev` branch. After fulfilling those points, make a pull request to the `dev` branch to make the all possible tests and checks on the developing feature. Only after all members have validated the feature, it can be merged into the `main` branch.
